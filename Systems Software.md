## OCR â€“ Optical Character Recognition
- OCR converts images of text into editable text with separate characters.
- OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) reads multi-choice answer papers and is able to recognise, based off which box is ticked, whether the candidate is right or wrong.
- Barcodes are a sequence of black and white lines, which are used to store a unique key for that product.
- The barcode allows devices reading the barcode to look up data about the product on a database.
- Different values are represented by different thicknesses of lines.
- At the start and end of the barcode there are terminators that allow the reader to know when the barcode begins and ends.

## Sensors and Actuators
An actuator is able to create something or make something happen. It is an output device which can cause physical movement.
Examples include motors, and automatic doors. Sensors and actuators form what is known as a feedback loop.

When a sensor detects a change, it tells the actuator to make a physical change to the system. This could, in turn, cause a change in what the sensors are detecting, which in turn can cause further activation of the actuator.

## Operating Systems
In your blogs - Research Operating systems:
- What they do?
- Why needed?
- What are the different functions i.e. file management etc
- What OS are available? How are these different?
