Memory and Storage
Storage factors
To compare storage types, we consider:
Speed
Cost
Capacity
Reliability
Portability
Durability
RAM
Usually quite large
Allows faster access to data
Volatile
Used to store data in use by the CPU
ROM
Used to store the boot program
Usually quite small
Non-volatile
Used in embedded systems
Can store some of the BIOS as well
Magnetic Storage
Relatively cheap form of storage
Large capacity
Slower than SSDs
Usually measured in Terabytes
Optical Storage
Cheap and easy to damage
Limited storage
Can store up to 700MB on discs and 3.2GB on Blu-Ray
Useful in storing music and videos
SSD
Faster and more reliable than Magnetic and Optical storage
Expensive but is likely to have a longer life than other storage
Smaller and more portable than Magnetic and Optical
Available to have high capacity

Virtual Storage
Area of secondary storage designated as RAM if it starts become too overused
Slower than RAM but prevents programs crashing because of not enough RAM
Virtual Storage is only ever temporary in the place of more RAM
