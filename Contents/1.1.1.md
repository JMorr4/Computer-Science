# Structure and function of the processor

## Memory and the CPU

### The Program Counter (PC)
- Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- After every executed instruction the counter will increment.
- Sometimes the counter increments by 1, but it can also increment by other amounts depending on where the next instruction needs to be fetched on in memory.

### Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Holds the address of the current instruction to be executed.
- It locates the place in memory (copied from the program counter) where the instruction soon to be in use is.

### Memory Data Register (MDR)
- Can contain both instructions and data.
- The instruction is stored here until it is sent to the CIR.
- The instruction is copied from the memory value located by the MAR.


### Current Instruction Register (CIR)
- Holds the current instruction being decoded and executed.


### The Control Unit (CU)
- Used for the co-ordination of the CPU activities.
- It sends electrical impulses to the other CPU components to control the flow of data around the system.
- The clock speed of a CPU is the number of instructions it can carry out per second. With each clock pulse, the Control Unit transfers instructions and dictates the CPU activities.

### Status Register (SR)
- Used in case of a data interruption or overflow.
- It is made up of several bits that are used to indicate whether there has been a failure of some sort within the CPU.


### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Carries out arithmetic and logical operations within the CPU.
- The results are then stored in the Accumulator.
- Arithmetic operations are simply number calculations , whereas logic operations use comparisons between the numbers in different memory locations.

### Accumulator (ACC)
- Stores the results of the ALU.
- Other registers within the CPU can also make use of the ACC.


### Data Bus
- A bus is a path which information can pass down.
- A data bus is used to transfer data between hardware.


### Address Bus
- Carries the address of the location to the data bus.
- Carries data in the form of binary.


### Control Bus
- Carries electrical signals sent from the CPU to other components.
- The control bus also carries the clock speed pulses, and transmits data in only one direction.

## CPU Performance

### Clock Speed
- Clock speed is the number of calculations the CPU carries out per second.
- A higer clock speed means a faster processor.

### Number of Cores
- However many tasks a computer can carry out simultaneously depends on the number of cores.
- If a computer has 4 cores, it can carry out 4 tasks at the same time.

### Cache
- Cache is a very small area of memory used to carry data within the CPU and prevent data bottlenecks.
- There can be two types of cache:
  - **L1 Cache** is primary cache, which is faster but has less memory storage
  - **L2 Cache** is secondary cache, which is slower but has a larger memory storage
