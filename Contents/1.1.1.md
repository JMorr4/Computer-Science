# Structure and function of the processor

## Memory and the CPU

### The Program Counter (PC)
- Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- After every executed instruction the counter will increment.
- Sometimes the counter increments by 1, but it can also increment by other amounts depending on where the next instruction needs to be fetched on in memory.

### Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Holds the address of the current instruction to be executed.
- It locates the place in memory (copied from the program counter) where the instruction soon to be in use is.

### Memory Data Register (MDR)
- Can contain both instructions and data.
- The instruction is stored here until it is sent to the CIR.
- The instruction is copied from the memory value located by the MAR.


### Current Instruction Register (CIR)
- Holds the current instruction being decoded and executed.


### The Control Unit (CU)
- Used for the co-ordination of the CPU activities.
- It sends electrical impulses to the other CPU components to control the flow of data around the system.
- The clock speed of a CPU is the number of instructions it can carry out per second. With each clock pulse, the Control Unit transfers instructions and dictates the CPU activities.

### Status Register (SR)
- Used in case of a data interruption or overflow.
- It is made up of several bits that are used to indicate whether there has been a failure of some sort within the CPU.


### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Carries out arithmetic and logical operations within the CPU.
- The results are then stored in the Accumulator.
- Arithmetic operations are simply number calculations , whereas logic operations use comparisons between the numbers in different memory locations.

### Accumulator (ACC)
- Stores the results of the ALU.
- Other registers within the CPU can also make use of the ACC.


### Data Bus
- A bus is a path which information can pass down.
- A data bus is used to transfer data between hardware.


### Address Bus
- Carries the address of the location to the data bus.
- Carries data in the form of binary.


### Control Bus
- Carries electrical signals sent from the CPU to other components.
- The control bus also carries the clock speed pulses, and transmits data in only one direction.

## CPU Performance

### Clock Speed
- Clock speed is the number of calculations the CPU carries out per second.
- A higer clock speed means a faster processor.

### Number of Cores
- However many tasks a computer can carry out simultaneously depends on the number of cores.
- If a computer has 4 cores, it can carry out 4 tasks at the same time.

### Cache
- Cache is a very small area of memory used to carry data within the CPU and prevent data bottlenecks.
- There can be two types of cache:
  - **L1 Cache** is primary cache, which is faster but has less memory storage
  - **L2 Cache** is secondary cache, which is slower but has a larger memory storage

### Heat Sink
- A computer's heat sink draws heat away from the CPU, preventing its tiny, delicate circuits from overheating. The large surface area of the heat sink, which is made up of many thin metal fins, allows it to efficiently cool the processor. ... Eventually, the CPU may begin to overheat due to this lower cooling power.
