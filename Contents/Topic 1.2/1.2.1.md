# Systems Software

## Operating Systems
An **operating system** provides the link between the hardware, software, and user in a computer system. It enables the user to communicate with the computer and perform low-level tasks like managing memory and resources. Examples of operating systems include Windows (Desktop) and Android (Mobile).

Operating systems provide the following features:
- Memory management
- Resource management
- File management
- Input/Output management
- Interrupt management
- Utility software
- Security
- User interface

## Memory Management
Main memory is not always large enough to store all the programs being used. To counter this, the OS determines and allocates processor time to each task using **paging**, **segementation** and **virtual memory**. This allows each task to get a fair share of the memory.

### Paging
Programs are split up into equally-sized sections called **pages**. Memory is also split up into pages. **Paging** is when the program pages are swapped between the memory and secondary storage as needed. Paging is therefore used for faster access to data, as it can transfer data from secondary storage to memory.

### Segmentation
**Segmentation** is when main memory is divided logically, not equally, into blocks called segments. This means each segment can be a different size, with segments being allocated to blocks of code such as conditional statements or loops.

### Virtual Memory
Running multiple applications quickly fills up the RAM, which slows down as it becomes full. To counter this, part of the hard drive is designated as **virtual memory** (temporary RAM), and non-essential data stored in the RAM is transferred here through paging. Access to virtual memory is slower than RAM, so the system will slow if this is relied on too much.

## Resource Management

### Scheduling
Another function of an OS is to ensure all the programs being run recieve a fair amount of processing time. This is done using **scheduling**. There are different methods of scheduling that an OS can use.

**Scheduling** ensures that the computer:
- Processes as many tasks as possible in a given time.
- Makes maximum use of CPU time.

#### Scheduling Methods

**Round Robin** - The Round Robin method uses the clock to generate interrupts to determine when a program should stop using the processor and another one should use it. Round Robin allocates a certain amount of processor time to each program, so this method guarantees reasonable response time for all users.

**First Come First Served** - Tasks are processed in the order in which they arrive, with no system priorities.

**Multi-level feedack queues** - This method determines which processes are most important, and aims to increase efficient processor use. It gives priority to shorter tasks and I/O bound processes. It seperates processes into categories based on their need for the processer, and implements multiple queues for different tasks based on the amount of processing time.

**Shortest Job First** - This method takes into consideration how time critical a task is. Shortest jobs are favoured, as it gives the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes. However, longer processes may not be able to use the processor if shorter tasks keep coming, which is called **starvation**.

**Shortest Remaining Time** - This method calculates the time it will take to carry out each task, and it carries out the shorter tasks first. However, as this method requires an estimation of the time to completion, it is usually used for batch or regular jobs because it's not efficient enough.

## Input/Output Management

### BIOS
The **Basic Input Output System** is the first program to run when a computer is turned on. Before the OS is loaded into memory from the hard drive, the BIOS is responsible for running various tests:
- **POST** (Power-On Self Test), which ensures all hardware devices are functional.
- Checking that the CPU is operational, specifically the clock, memory and processor.
- Testing for external memory devices connected to the computer.

### Device Drivers
**Device drivers** are programs provided by the OS which allow the OS to interact with the hardware. For example, when a keyboard is used, the device driver communicates this request to the OS, which can then produce the relevant output - in this case displaying a letter on the screen.

Device drivers are specific to the OS installed on the device and the device type (smartphone, PC, etc.).

<br>

## Interrupt Management
**Interrupts** are signals generated by a software or hardware source to request processing time from the CPU. Different interrupt types have different priorities, and this must be taken into account when a request comes through.

#### Types of interrupts:
- Hardware failure (Priority 1)
    - Generated by the failure of hardware devices in the computer
    - e.g. Hard drive failure
- Program interrupt (Priority 2)
    - Generated by conditions in a program
    - e.g. Division by 0
- Timer (Priority 3)
    - Generated by the timer within the processor. This allows the OS to perfom ceratin function at regular intervals.
- Input/Output (Priority 4)
    - Generated by an input or output device
    - e.g. Mouse click, printer out of paper

## Types of Operating System

| Type  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Distributed** | Runs across multiple devices, allowing the load to be spread across multiple computer processors when a task is run |
| **Embedded** | Performs a specific task within a larger device. Although it has limited functionality, they consume much less power than other OS types  |
| **Multi-tasking** | Enables the user to carry out tasks almost simulatenously using **time slicing** to switch quickly between programs in memory |
| **Multi-user** | Multiple users use one computer, typically a supercomputer, in a multi-user system. This is possible due to scheduling |
| **Real Time** | Commonly used in time-critical computer systems. It is designed to perform a task within a guaranteed time frame. |

## OCR – Optical Character Recognition
- OCR converts images of text into editable text with separate characters.
- OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) reads multi-choice answer papers and is able to recognise, based off which box is ticked, whether the candidate is right or wrong.
- Barcodes are a sequence of black and white lines, which are used to store a unique key for that product.
- The barcode allows devices reading the barcode to look up data about the product on a database.
- Different values are represented by different thicknesses of lines.
- At the start and end of the barcode there are terminators that allow the reader to know when the barcode begins and ends.

## Sensors and Actuators
An actuator is able to create something or make something happen. It is an output device which can cause physical movement.
Examples include motors, and automatic doors. Sensors and actuators form what is known as a feedback loop.

When a sensor detects a change, it tells the actuator to make a physical change to the system. This could, in turn, cause a change in what the sensors are detecting, which in turn can cause further activation of the actuator.

### Types of OS
- Distributed OS - this is type of OS that is run on multiple processor allowing it to distribute tasks.
- Embedded OS - this is an OS that preforms a small range of specific task on a sungle device which allows it consume less power.

| Type  | Definition | Example of Use |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Batch OS  | Programs are collected, grouped, and processed at a later date.  | Payroll, stock control and billing systems.  |
| Interactive OS  | Allows the user and the computer to be in a direct two-way communication.  | Select from a menu at an ATM.   |
| Real-time OS | Inputs immediately affect the outputs. Timing is critical | Control of nuclear power plants, air traffic control systems.  |
| Network OS  | Allow a computer on a network to serve requests from other computers for data and provide access to other resources such as printer and file systems.  | Manage simultaneous access by multiple users  |
| Multiuser OS | Handle many people running their programmes on the computer at the same time | A number of terminals communicating with a central computer which allocates processing time to each terminal in turn.  |
| Multiprogramming OS  | Ability to run many programmes apparently at the same time.  | Mainframe systems. Each job is allocated a small amount of processing time (time slice) in turn.  |
| Multitasking OS  | The ability to hold several programmes in RAM at one time but the user switches between them.   | Usually uses GUI’s. Facilitates import and export of data. |

### Processor Management
Processor management means the operating system will divide the processor up into sections, each assigned to carry out seperate tasks.

### Memory Management
Memory management means controlling and coordinating memory, assigning portions called "blocks" to various running programs to optimise overall system performance.

### Peripheral Management
Peripheral devices, such as speakers or keyboards, are hardware devices that are connected to the computer and can communicate with it. They are able to do this because of the OS, which controls the connection between all hardware, software and peripheral devices in a computer system.

### Utility Software
Utility software is designed to maintain a computer system and optimise it's functions. These are several examples of utility software:
- Data compression
- Defragmentation
- Backups
- Encryption

### Networking
Processor management means the operating system will divide the processor up into sections, each assigned to carry out seperate tasks.
