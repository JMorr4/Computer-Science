# Systems Software

## Operating Systems
An **operating system** provides the link between the hardware, software, and user in a computer system. It enables the user to communicate with the computer and perform low-level tasks like managing memory and resources. Examples of operating systems include Windows (Desktop) and Android (Mobile).

Operating systems provide the following features:
- Memory management
- Resource management
- File management
- Input/Output management
- Interrupt management
- Utility software
- Security
- User interface

## Memory Management
A computer allows the user to work on multiple tasks at the same time. Each task must be allocated a specific area of memory whilst the computer is running, and this is controlled by the OS.

Main memory is not always large enough to store all the programs being used. To counter this, the OS determines and allocates processor time to each task using **paging**, **segementation** and **virtual memory**. This allows each task to get a fair share of the memory.

### Paging
Programs are split up into equally-sized sections called **pages**. Memory is also split up into pages. **Paging** is when the program pages are swapped between the memory and secondary storage as needed. Paging is therefore used for faster access to data, as it can transfer data from secondary storage to memory.

### Segmentation
**Segmentation** is when main memory is divided logically, not equally, into blocks called segments. This means each segment can be a different size, with segments being allocated to blocks of code such as conditional statements or loops.

### Virtual Memory
Running multiple applications quickly fills up the RAM, which slows down as it becomes full. To counter this, part of the hard drive is designated as **virtual memory** (temporary RAM), and non-essential data stored in the RAM is transferred here through paging. Access to virtual memory is slower than RAM, so the system will slow if this is relied on too much.

## Resource Management

### Scheduling
Another function of an OS is to ensure all the programs being run recieve a fair amount of processing time. This is done using **scheduling**. There are different methods of scheduling that an OS can use.

**Scheduling** ensures that the computer:
- Processes as many tasks as possible in a given time.
- Makes maximum use of CPU time.

#### Scheduling Methods

**Round Robin** - The Round Robin method uses the clock to generate interrupts to determine when a program should stop using the processor and another one should use it. Round Robin allocates a certain amount of processor time to each program, so this method guarantees reasonable response time for all users.

**First Come First Served** - Tasks are processed in the order in which they arrive, with no system priorities.

**Multi-level feedack queues** - This method determines which processes are most important, and aims to increase efficient processor use. It gives priority to shorter tasks and I/O bound processes. It seperates processes into categories based on their need for the processer, and implements multiple queues for different tasks based on the amount of processing time.

**Shortest Job First** - This method takes into consideration how time critical a task is. Shortest jobs are favoured, as it gives the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes. However, longer processes may not be able to use the processor if shorter tasks keep coming, which is called **starvation**.

**Shortest Remaining Time** - This method calculates the time it will take to carry out each task, and it carries out the shorter tasks first. However, as this method requires an estimation of the time to completion, it is usually used for batch or regular jobs because it's not efficient enough.

## Input/Output Management

### BIOS
The **Basic Input Output System** is the first program to run when a computer is turned on. Before the OS is loaded into memory from the hard drive, the BIOS is responsible for running various tests:
- **POST** (Power-On Self Test), which ensures all hardware devices are functional.
- Checking that the CPU is operational, specifically the clock, memory and processor.
- Testing for external memory devices connected to the computer.

### Device Drivers
**Device drivers** are programs provided by the OS which allow the OS to interact with the hardware. For example, when a keyboard is used, the device driver communicates this request to the OS, which can then produce the relevant output - in this case displaying a letter on the screen.

Device drivers are specific to the OS installed on the device and the device type (smartphone, PC, etc.).

## Interrupt Management
**Interrupts** are signals generated by a software or hardware source to request processing time from the CPU. Different interrupt types have different priorities, and this must be taken into account when a request comes through. It is because of processor interrupts that **multi-tasking** can take place.

#### Types of interrupts:
- Hardware failure (Priority 1)
    - Generated by the failure of hardware devices in the computer
    - e.g. Hard drive failure
- Program interrupt (Priority 2)
    - Generated by conditions in a program
    - e.g. Division by 0
- Timer (Priority 3)
    - Generated by the timer within the processor. This allows the OS to perfom ceratin function at regular intervals.
- Input/Output (Priority 4)
    - Generated by an input or output device
    - e.g. Mouse click, printer out of paper

## Types of Operating System

| Type  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Distributed** | Runs across multiple devices, allowing the load to be spread across multiple computer processors when a task is run |
| **Embedded** | Performs a specific task within a larger device. Although it has limited functionality, they consume much less power than other OS types  |
| **Multi-tasking** | Enables the user to carry out tasks almost simultaneously using **time slicing** to switch quickly between programs in memory |
| **Multi-user** | Multiple users use one computer, typically a supercomputer, in a multi-user system. This is possible due to **multi-tasking** |
| **Real Time** | Commonly used in time-critical computer systems. It is designed to perform a task within a guaranteed time frame |
| **Mobile** | Combines the features of a normal OS with their own special features, such as managing cellular and wireless activity |

## Virtual Machines
A **virtual machine** is a software implementation of a computer system. It provides an environment with a translator for intermediate code to run. **Intermediate code** is code who's complexity lies between machine code and high-level code.

Virtual machines are often used for developers to test programs on different operating systems, saving both time and money. However, running intermediate code in a virtual machine can also be considerably slower than low-level code on a normal OS.

Other uses of virtual machines include:
- Protection from malware, as the malware will affect the virtual machine instead of the device being used.
- Running incompatible software, saving the need to buy a new device just to run an OS.
