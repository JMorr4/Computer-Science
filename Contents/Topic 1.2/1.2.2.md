# Applications Generation

## Applications
Software can be categorised as either **applications software** or **system software**.

### Application software
**Application software** is a computer program designed to help the user perform a specific activity.

Examples include:
- Word processors
- Web browsers
- Spreadsheets

### Systems software
**System software** is responsible for running the computer system, interacting with hardware and generally providing a platform for applications software to run. This ensures high computer performace for the user, even if the user does not directly interact with system software.

Examples include:
- Operating systems
- Device drivers
- Utility programs

## Utility Software
Operating systems provide **utilities** that are important to the performance of an OS. Each utility program has a specific function, such as:
- Compression
- Disk defragmentation
- Antivirus
- Automatic updating
- Backups

### Compression
This enables files to be compressed and decompressed. This can be used when large files need to be transmitted across the Internet.

### Disk defragmentation
As the hard drive fills up, it slows down. This is due to files becoming **fragmentated** as they are stored in **non-contigous** locations in memory. This affects the read/write times, as it takes longer for the files to be found if they are not stored in the same place.

However, the **defragmentation** utility rearranges the files in the hard drive to be stored in the same location, improving performance.

### Antivirus
**Antivirus** is responsible for detecting and removing potential threats to the computer.

### Automatic updating
This utility ensures the OS is always kept up to date, with any updates being automatically installed when the computer is restarted. This helps tackle bugs or security flaws, keeping the computer safe from malware threats.

### Backups
The **backup** utility routinely creates copies of specific files selected by the user. How often these files are backed up is also specified by the user. This means backed up files can be recovered in the case of an accident.
