# Input, Output and Storage

## Input and output devices

### Input devices
An **input device** feeds information and data into a computer for processing. Examples of these include:
- Keyboards
- Webcams
- Barcode readers

An **output device** displays the result of the computer's processing. Examples of these include:
- Speakers
- Monitors
- Printers

Some devices can be categorised as both an input and output device. **Touchscreen** takes in information using it's sensors whilst displaying information like a monitor.

# Memory and Storage

## Storage factors
To compare storage types, we consider:
- Speed
- Cost
- Capacity
- Reliability
- Portability
- Durability

## RAM
- Usually quite large
- Allows faster access to data
- Volatile
- Used to store data in use by the CPU

## ROM
- Used to store the boot program
- Usually quite small
- Non-volatile
- Used in embedded systems
- Can store some of the BIOS as well

## Magnetic Storage
- Relatively cheap form of storage
- Large capacity
- Slower than SSDs
- Usually measured in Terabytes

## Optical Storage
- Cheap and easy to damage
- Limited storage
- Can store up to 700MB on discs and 3.2GB on Blu-Ray
- Useful in storing music and videos

## SSD
- Faster and more reliable than Magnetic and Optical storage
- Expensive but is likely to have a longer life than other storage
- Smaller and more portable than Magnetic and Optical
- Available to have high capacity

## Virtual Storage
- Area of secondary storage designated as RAM if it starts become too overused
- Slower than RAM but prevents programs crashing because of not enough RAM
- Virtual Storage is only ever temporary in the place of more RAM
