# Input, Output and Storage

## Input and output devices

### Input devices
An **input device** feeds information and data into a computer for processing. Examples of these include:
- Keyboards
- Webcams
- Barcode readers

An **output device** displays the result of the computer's processing. Examples of these include:
- Speakers
- Monitors
- Printers

Some devices can be categorised as both an input and output device. **Touchscreen** takes in information using it's sensors whilst displaying information like a monitor.

## Storage devices

### Storage factors
There are a variety of different ways of storing information. There are 3 main storage types: **Magnetic**, **Optical** and **Flash**, each of which is suited to a particular type of information.

To compare storage types, we consider:
- Speed
- Cost
- Capacity
- Reliability
- Portability
- Durability

<br>

### Magnetic
**Magnetic storage** uses two magnetic states to represent binary information: **Polarised** and **unpolarised**. These two states represent the binary digits 1 & 0.

Advantages:
- Relatively cheap form of storage
- Large capacity, usually measured in Terabytes

Disadvantages:
- Slow data transfer speeds
- Easily damaged
- Could be unreliable due to moving parts

<br>

### Optical
**Optical storage** are read from and written to using lasers.

The surface of an optical device is made up of flat and sunken portions. The flat portions, called "lands", reflect the laser light that lands on it, whereas the sunken portions, called "pits", scatter it.

In binary, lands represent a **1** and pits represent a **0**.

Advantages:
- Cheap form of storage
- Very portable, so useful for storing music and videos

Disadvantages:
- Small capacity
- Easily damaged by scratches
- Slow transfer speeds

### Flash
**Flash storage** is fast and compact. It works using logic gates to store electrical charge in one of two states: high or low (1 or 0). Information is stored in **pages**, which are combined to form **blocks**.

Flash memory can be erased and reprogrammed electronically, and is **non-volatile**. Although flash memory is similar to RAM, the two differ in that RAM is volatile, so it loses its contents when power is lost, whereas flash memory retains its information.

One problem with flash memory is its limited lifespan. Every time a page is written to, the voltage required to write it increases. Over time, the required voltage will become too high for the page to be written to.

Advantages:
- Extremely light and portable
- Durable due to no moving parts
- High data transfer rates

Disadvantages:
- Expensive
- Limited lifespan




# Memory and Storage

## Storage factors
To compare storage types, we consider:
- Speed
- Cost
- Capacity
- Reliability
- Portability
- Durability

## RAM
- Usually quite large
- Allows faster access to data
- Volatile
- Used to store data in use by the CPU

## ROM
- Used to store the boot program
- Usually quite small
- Non-volatile
- Used in embedded systems
- Can store some of the BIOS as well



## Optical Storage
- Cheap and easy to damage
- Limited storage
- Can store up to 700MB on discs and 3.2GB on Blu-Ray
- Useful in storing music and videos

## SSD
- Faster and more reliable than Magnetic and Optical storage
- Expensive but is likely to have a longer life than other storage
- Smaller and more portable than Magnetic and Optical
- Available to have high capacity

## Virtual Storage
- Area of secondary storage designated as RAM if it starts become too overused
- Slower than RAM but prevents programs crashing because of not enough RAM
- Virtual Storage is only ever temporary in the place of more RAM
