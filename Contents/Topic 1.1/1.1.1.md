### CPU
The Central Processing Unit (CPU), is made up of several components which enable it to execute instructions. These include:
- Control Unit
- Buses
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Registers

<br>

### The Control Unit (CU)
- Used for the co-ordination of the CPU activities.
- It sends electrical impulses to the other CPU components to control the flow of data around the system.
- The Control Unit takes in the next instruction, decodes it into several steps, manages its execution and stores the result back in memory or registers.

### Buses

A **bus** is a set of parallel wires connecting two or more components of a computer. The CPU is connected to main memory by three seperate buses:
- When the CPU wishes to access a particular memory location, it sends the address to memory on the **address bus**.
- The data in that location is then returned to the CPU on the **data bus**.
- Control signals are sent along the **control bus**.

Data and control signals travel in both directions between the CPU, memory and peripheral controllers. Addresses travel in only one direction along the address bus, from the CPU to it's destination.

#### Control Bus
- The purpose of the Control Bus is to carry electrical signals from the CPU to other components. These impulses can carry command, timing or status information.
- The control bus also carries the clock speed pulses, and transmits data in only one direction.

#### Data Bus
- The data bus provides a path for data and instructions to travel along between system components.

#### Address Bus
- Memory is divided up into unit called **words**. These words are used as operands in program insructions.
- A word is typically 16 or 32 bits, and each word in memory has a different address.
- The Address Bus carries these word addresses between components so that the data can be retrieved and sent back to the CPU.

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

- Carries out arithmetic and logical operations within the CPU.
- The results are then stored in the Accumulator.
- Arithmetic operations performs instructions on fixed or floating point numbers.
- Logical operations carries out Boolean logic operations

<br>

### Registers

#### The Program Counter (PC)
- Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- After every executed instruction the counter will increment so that it holds the address of the next instruction.
- The next insruction can simply be the next in sequence, or, if the current instruction is a branch or jump instruction, it can be copied from the Current Instruction Register.

#### Current Instruction Register (CIR)
- Holds the current instruction being executed.

#### Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Holds the address of the current instruction being executed.
- It locates the place in memory (copied from the program counter) where the instruction soon to be in use is.

#### Memory Data Register (MDR)
- Used to temporarily store the data read or written from memory.
- The data is copied from the memory value located by the MAR, then stored here until sent to the CIR.

#### Status Register (SR)
- Used in case of a data interruption or overflow.
- It is made up of several bits that are used to indicate whether there has been a failure of some sort within the CPU.

<br>

### Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

#### Fetch
- The address of the next instruction is copied from the Program Counter to the MAR.
- The instruction held at that address is copied to the MDR, and the content of the Program Counter is incremented.
- The contents of the MDR are copied to the CIR.

#### Decode
The instruction in the CIR is split up into **opcode** and **operand**. The opcode is used to determine the type of instruction and what hardware to use to execute it, and the operand holds either:
- The address of the data to be used with the operation, which is then copied to the MDR
- The actual data to be operated on, which will be copied to the MDR

#### Execute
The data to be operated on may be passed to the ALU depending on the instructions, and the instruction is carried out.

## CPU Performance

The main factors affecting CPU performance are:
- Clock speed
- Number of cores
- Cache

### Clock Speed
- Clock speed is the number of calculations the CPU carries out per second.
- A higer clock speed means a faster processor.

### Number of Cores
- However many tasks a computer can carry out simultaneously depends on the number of cores.
- If a computer has 4 cores, it can carry out 4 tasks at the same time.

### Cache
- Cache is a very small area of memory used to carry data within the CPU and prevent data bottlenecks.
- There can be two types of cache:
  - **L1 Cache** is primary cache, which is faster but has less memory storage
  - **L2 Cache** is secondary cache, which is slower but has a larger memory storage

### Heat Sink
- A computer's heat sink draws heat away from the CPU, preventing its tiny, delicate circuits from overheating. The large surface area of the heat sink, which is made up of many thin metal fins, allows it to efficiently cool the processor. ... Eventually, the CPU may begin to overheat due to this lower cooling power.
