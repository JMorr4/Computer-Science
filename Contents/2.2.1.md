# Programming Techniques

## Programming Constructs: Sequence, iteration, branching

## Recursion

Another key feature of declarative languages is the use of recursion. Rules are normally created to call other facts or rules. Recursion takes place when a rule calls itself. A commonly used example of recursion is that of a rule about ancestry.

ancestor_of(X,Y):- parent_of(X,Z), ancestor_of(Z,Y)

This reads as 'X is an ancestor of Y if X is a parent of Z and Z is an ancestor of Y'. Recursion is evident here as the rule ancestor_of(X,Y) calls itself within the rule definition â€“ ancestor_of(Z,Y).
