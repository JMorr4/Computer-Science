# Programming Techniques

## Programming Constructs
Types of Constructs:
- A **Sequence** is when tasks are carried out step by step.
- **Iteration** is when certain tasks are repeated until a certain condition is met.
- **Selection** is when a decision needs to be made before the next step can be carried out

## Recursion

Sometimes a problem is too difficult or too complex to solve because it is too big. If the problem can be broken down into smaller versions of itself, we may be able to find a way to solve one of these smaller versions and then be able to build up to a solution to the entire problem. This is the idea behind **recursion**; recursive algorithms break down a problem into smaller pieces which you either already know the answer to, or can solve by applying the same algorithm to each piece, and then combining the results.

In python, recursion can be used by calling a function within the function itself, as shown below:

```python
def function(n):
  if n > 0:
    n -= 1
    function(n)    
 
function(5)
```

## Global and Local Variables

### Local Variables

Local variables in python are variables declared within a function, as seen below:

```python
def function():
  n = "Hello"
  print(n)
  
function()
```

This will output ```Hello```, because the variable is known within the function. However, when the print statement is called outside the function...

```python
def function():
  n = "Hello"

function()
print(n)
```
<br>

### Global Variables

In python, global variables are useful in dealing with functions. Usually a programmer would use ```return n``` to pass the variable out of the function, but one way of getting round this is to declare the variable global, using ```global(n)```, as seen below:

``` python
def function(n):
  n += 1
  return n

function()
```

``` python
def function(n):
  global(n)
  n += 1

function()
```

## Modularity, functions and procedures, parameter passing by value and by reference

## Uses of an IDE

Common tools and facilities available:
- **Editors** allow programmers to edit their code
- **Error diagnostics** present information following an error and assist in identifying the cause of the error
- Run-time environment
- Translators
