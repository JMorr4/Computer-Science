# Data Types

**Note**: File does not include conversions between Binary, Denary and Hexidecimal.

### Primitive data types

- An **integer** is a whole number, which can't have a fractional part.
- A **real** number is an integer that can have a fractional part. They can be represented using floating point.
- A **character** is a single symbol used by a computer, including the alphabet, integers 0 to 9 and symbols such as %.
- A **string** is a collection of characters.
- **Boolean** values are restricted to True and False, which is used in binary.

## Negative numbers in binary

### Sign and magnitude
- The binary number is split into two parts: The **sign** and the **magnitude**:
  - The **sign** determines whether the number is positive or negative, with a 0 meaning positive and a 1 meaning negative.
  - The **magnitude** determines the size of the number.
- For example, 110101100 is equal to -172, as the first bit (the sign) is a one and the magnitude (the next seven bits) is equal to 172.

### Two's complement
- To convert to **Two's complement**, you have to:
  - Invert all the 1s and 0s in the binary number
  - Add one

This means that the most significant bit of the number is now represented by its negative counterpart, like so:

#### Subtracting numbers with Two's complement
Subtracting a number from another is the same as adding a negative number. Here, the numbers 8 & -12 are added to together, both in Two's complement.

## Floating Point numbers in binary

Floating point numbers are split into two parts: The **mantissa** and the **exponent**:
- The **mantissa** represents the number itself
- The **exponent** determines where we're going to put our floating point

There is also a single bit dedicated to the **sign**, which determines whether our number is positive or negative.

#### Example 1

Here we have a 10-bit mantissa and a 6-bit exponent.

- Here our number is positive, because the sign is 0.
- Next, we put down the starting position for our floating point, which comes after the most significant bit.
- Then we convert the exponent to decimal, which, in this case, is 5.
- Positive 5 means you move the floating point 5 places to the right.
- Finally, we can convert the number to denary, as shown:

#### Example 2

However, if the exponent is negative, there are some changes to the method

- Our number is now negative, because the sign is 1.
- The starting position for our floating point is still after the most significant bit.
- Now, when we convert the exponent to denary, we get -3.
- Because the number is negative, you move the floating point 3 places to the left instead. If there's no room to move it left, then you can add however many 0s to the start of the mantissa, then move your point accordingly, as such:
