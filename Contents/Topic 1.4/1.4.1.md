# Data Types

**Note**: File does not include conversions between Binary, Denary and Hexidecimal.

### Primitive data types

- An **integer** is a whole number, which can't have a fractional part.
- A **real** number is an integer that can have a fractional part. They can be represented using floating point.
- A **character** is a single symbol used by a computer, including the alphabet, integers 0 to 9 and symbols such as %.
- A **string** is a collection of characters.
- **Boolean** values are restricted to True and False, which is used in binary.

## Negative numbers in binary

### Sign and magnitude
- The binary number is split into two parts: The **sign** and the **magnitude**:
  - The **sign** determines whether the number is positive or negative, with a 0 meaning positive and a 1 meaning negative.
  - The **magnitude** determines the size of the number.
- For example, 110101100 is equal to -172, as the first bit (the sign) is a one and the magnitude (the next seven bits) is equal to 172.

### Two's complement
- To convert to **Two's complement**, you have to:
  - Invert all the 1s and 0s in the binary number
  - Add one

This means that the most significant bit of the number is now represented by its negative counterpart, like so:

#### Subtracting numbers with Two's complement
Subtracting a number from another is the same as adding a negative number. Here, the numbers 8 & -12 are added to together, both in Two's complement.
