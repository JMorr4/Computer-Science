## Relational Databases

- An **entity** is an object that exists in real life.
- An **attribute** are the characteristics of an entity.
- A **relational database** creates different tables for each entity, linked together by a shared attribute.
- Relational databases are more efficient than flat-file databases because:
    - They take up less space and memory
    - They have reduced chance of **data redundancy**, meaning a lesser chance of data being partially duplicated across         records

- *Class* is a **primary** key in *Class* table, and a **foreign** key in *Student* table

# Databases

## Database types
- A flat file database is a database with only one table.
- A table orders information in columns and rows, or records and fields in database terms.
- An entity is an object that exists in real life. For example, if you were making an entity for the house someone lives in.
- A field in a database is the same as a column.
- A record in a database is the same as a row.
- Validation checks that the user has inputted the required information or data type for the field.
- A query is used to retrieve information from a database. Simple queries return a small number of fields, whereas complex fields are able to show the user large parts of databases.
- A report presents the information in a database in a user-friendly fashion.

## Types of Validation

- **Format Check** - Makes sure the data inserted into the field matches the right format     <br>
  Example: If you were to input your age, a format check would make sure it was an integer, not a string

- **Length Check** - Checks the data to see if it fits the field input length   <br>
  Example: A telephone number that can only be 11 digits
  
- **Presence Check** - Checks that a field has not been left blank in a database    <br>
  Example: If there is no data inputted into a field in a database, it‚Äôs common that an alert will pop up telling you not to leave it blank
  
- **Range Check** - Checks that the number inputted is within the specified range     <br>
  Example: Age must be between 0 and 120

- **Spell Check** - Compares your inputted words to those of the dictionary and if they don‚Äôt match, it pops up with an error     <br>
  Example: In applications such as Microsoft Word or other word processors.

## SQL
  
Data Type | Description
------------ | -------------
CHAR(ùë•) | Allows the user to input a string of fixed length ùë•
VARCHAR(ùë•) | Allows the user to input a string of max length ùë•

## Normalisation and Relational Databases

### Normalisation
- Normalisation is a process used to come up with the best possible design for a database.
- Tables should be organised so that data is not duplicated in the same table or in different tables.
- The structure should allow complex queries to be made.
- There are three stages in normalisation, called First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF).

#### First Normal Form (1NF)
- A table is in 1NF if it contains no repeating attributes or groups of attributes.
- All attributes must be **atomic**, meaning a single attribute can't contain two data items, such as firstname and surname. This would make it difficult to sort on the surname.

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- A table is in 2NF if it is in !NF and contains no partial dependencies.
- This can only occur if the primary key is a **composite key**.

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and contains no non-key dependacies.
- Third Normal Form can be defined by saying:
> The attributes are dependant on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

## Data Capture

### Automated methods

Automated data capture is useful in taking in large amounts of data that is easy to input. Some methods include:
- Smart card readers
- Barcode readers
- Scanners
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Optical mark recognition (OMR)
- Magnetic ink character recognition
- Sensors

## ACID

ACID stands for **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation and **D**urability.

This is a set of properties to ensure that the integrity of the database is maintained under all circumstances. It guarantees that transactions are processed properly.

### Atomicity

Atomicity requires that a transaction should be processed properly or not at all.
In any situation, including power cuts or suchlike, it's not possible to process only part of a transaction.

### Consistency

Consistency ensures that no transaction can violate any of the defined validation rules.

### Isolation

Isolation ensures that the simultaneous execution of transaction leads to the same result, as if transactions were proccessed one after the other.
This is crucial in a multi-user database.

### Durability

Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a power cut.
As each part of a transaction is completed, the data is held in a buffer until all elements of the transactions are completed.

## Referential Integrity

- A primary key is a key that uniquely indentifies the values in a table.
- A foreign key is a primary key from another table.
- A composite key is the same primary key across two tables.

Refers to the relationship between tables. In a relational database, different tables might share the same primary key because it relates to the data in those separate tables. Referential integrity is the dependency of a foreign key on a primary key.
