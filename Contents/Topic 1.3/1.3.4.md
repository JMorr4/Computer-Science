# Web Technologies

## HTML
**HTML** allows a browser to **interpret** and **render** a webpage for the viewer by describing the structure and order of the webpage.
There are two main sections of a webpage, the **body** and the **head**. The head contains the title of the webpage and the body contains the contents of the webpage.

| HTML Tag  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```<html>``` | All code written within these tags is interpreted as HTML |
| ```<body>``` | Defines the content in the main browser content area |
|```<link>```| Used to link to additional files, including CSS stylesheets |
|```<head>```| Defines the browser tab or window heading area |
|```<title>```| Defines the text that appears with the tab or window heading area |
|```<h1>, <h2>, <h3>```| Heading styles in decreasing sizes |
|```<p>```| A paragraph separated with a line space above and below |
|```<img>```| A self-closing tag used for images. The following tag parameters must be included: <br> ```img src``` = location ; ```height``` = x ; ```width``` = y <br> **e.g.** ```<img src = "File.png" width="400" height="600">``` |
|```<a>```| Creates a hyperlink with the location parameter <br> **e.g.** ```<a href="https://www.google.com"> Google </a>``` |
|```<ol>```| Defines an ordered list |
|```<ul>```| Defines an unordered list |
|```<div>```| Self-closing tag which divides the HTML code into seperate areas, which can each be referred to by a unique name. <br> **e.g.** ```<div id= "page">``` |

### Classes and Identifiers
**Classes** and **identifiers** are attributes given to elements on a webpage that a programmer wishes to style.

#### Classes
Classes are defined using a full stop. They are defined once, usually within the head of a webpage or in a linked CSS style sheet, and multiple elements can be associated with a particular class.

#### Identifiers
Identifiers are defined using a hashtag. Only one element can be associated with a unique identifier.

### CSS
**Cascading style sheets** is used to describe the style of a webpage. It can be used in two different forms:
- **Internal CSS** is placed inside the style tags and is entered directly into the HTML document.
- **External CSS** is written in a seperate document and a link to this style sheet is added to the HTML document.


Whenever an external style sheet is used, the following link is added to the header:

```
<link href= "styleSheetName.css" rel= "stylesheet" type= "text/css"> 
```

CSS has a specific syntax that must be followed, as shown below. Each section of CSS begins with the name of the class/identifier or element to be styled. Then comes a set of curly brackets within which the attributes of the element are defined.

```CSS
body 
{ 
  margin: 0px;  
  padding: 0px; 
  background-color: white; 
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
  font-size: 18px; 
  Text-align: center; 
}
```

### Javascript
**Javascript** primarily exists to add **interactivity** to a website. It is interpreted rather than compiled, and is often used to validate input data on the client computer.

Javascript is useful as it means the local computer can deal with invalid data before it is sent off to the server. This eases the load on busy servers and reduces web traffic.

Some uses of Javascript are;
- Changing the attributes of a HTML element
- Writing directly to the document
- Displaying an alert box

## Search Engine Indexing

### Search Engines
A **search engine** is a program that searches through the database of internet addresses, looking for resources based on specifications set by the client.

One of the aims of a search engine is to display the highest quality websites with the most relevant content to the user before worse picks. How they do this is down to an index of web pages. **Web crawlers** are used to collect information about websites to add to this index.

### PageRank Algorithm
The **page rank algorithm** ranks webpages to determine which one to display to the user. Higher ranked webpages will show up first, as these are the most likely ones for the user to click on. There are two factors which determine the page rank of a webpage:
- How many incoming links it has from other webpages
- The **page rank** of the webpages linking to it

This is calculated using the formula:

```PageRank(x) = (1-d) + d[(PageRank(T1) ÷ Count(T1)) + … + (PageRank(Tn) ÷ Count(Tn)]```
```
PageRank(x) = Page rank of page x
Count(Tn) = Total count of outbound links from webpage n
d = Damping factor, usually set to 0.85
```
