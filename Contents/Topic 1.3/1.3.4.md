## HTML
**HTML** allows a browser to **interpret** and **render** a webpage for the viewer by describing the structure and order of the webpage.
There are two main sections of a webpage, the **body** and the **head**. The head contains the title of the webpage and the body contains the contents of the webpage.

| HTML Tag  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```<html>``` | All code written within these tags is interpreted as HTML |
| ```<body>``` | Defines the content in the main browser content area |
|```<link>```| This is used to link to a css stylesheet (explained later in the notes) |
|```<head>```| Defines the browser tab or window heading area |
|```<title>```| Defines the text that appears with the tab or window heading area |
|```<h1>, <h2>, <h3>```| Heading styles in decreasing sizes |
|```<p>```| A paragraph separated with a line space above and below |
|```<img>```| Self closing image with parameters (img src = location, height=x, width = y) |
|```<a>```| Anchor tag defining a hyperlink with location parameters |
|```<ol>```| Defines an ordered list |
|```<ul>```| Defines an unordered list |
|```<li>```| Defines an individual list item |

## Classes and Identifiers
Class and identifier selectors are the names which you style, this means groups of items can be styled, the selectors for HTML are usually the div tags.
Identifiers are defined with a hash symbol and must be unique to each webpage.
Classes are defined with a full stop as a prefix to the class name and can be used multiple times on a webpage.

### CSS

- CSS can be used to specify the way HTML elements look, they can be applied to whole tags such as ```<h1>```, ```<p>``` or ```<div>```.
- CSS can be used using two different form, internal / embedded or external CSS the internal CSS is when the style is placed.
- The internal / embedded CSS is placed inside the style tags and is entered directly within the HTML document.
