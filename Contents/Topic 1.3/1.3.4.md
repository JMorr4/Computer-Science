## HTML
**HTML** allows a browser to **interpret** and **render** a webpage for the viewer by describing the structure and order of the webpage.
There are two main sections of a webpage, the **body** and the **head**. The head contains the title of the webpage and the body contains the contents of the webpage.

| HTML Tag  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```<html>``` | All code written within these tags is interpreted as HTML |
| ```<body>``` | Defines the content in the main browser content area |
|```<link>```| Used to link to additional files, including CSS stylesheets |
|```<head>```| Defines the browser tab or window heading area |
|```<title>```| Defines the text that appears with the tab or window heading area |
|```<h1>, <h2>, <h3>```| Heading styles in decreasing sizes |
|```<p>```| A paragraph separated with a line space above and below |
|```<img>```| A self-closing tag used for images. The following tag parameters must be included: <br> ```img src``` = location ; ```height``` = x ; ```width``` = y <br> **e.g.** ```<img src = "File.png" width="400" height="600">``` |
|```<a>```| Creates a hyperlink with the location parameter <br> **e.g.** ```<a href="https://www.google.com"> Google </a>``` |

Identifiers are defined with a hash symbol and must be unique to each webpage.
Classes are defined with a full stop as a prefix to the class name and can be used multiple times on a webpage.
