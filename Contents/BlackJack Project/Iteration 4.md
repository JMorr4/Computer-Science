## Iteration 4

To start off with, I wanted to change IDEs from Python IDLE to Visual Studio 2019, in order to access more features to help me. During this, I needed to do some folder admin and hardcoding directories into my code.

Changed over to visual studio

Added some code to prevent the same card from spawning twice, and also to stop the program crashing whenever the cards ran out
