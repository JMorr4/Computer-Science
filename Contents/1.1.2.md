## Von Neumann, Harvard and Contemporary Architectures
In **Von Neumann Architecture**, data and instructions are stored together in the same memory and share the same data bus. However, some computers, mainly specialist and embedded systems, use **Harvard Architecture**.

In Harvard Architecture, data and instructions are stored separately, and use different data buses.

### Von Neumann Architecture

Advantages | Disadvantages                            
------------ | -------------
Only one data bus so less <br /> complex and easier to manage.| Cannot carry out parallel processing as <br /> it carries out one intruction at a time.
One data bus means cheaper <br /> manufacturing costs.|
Memory can be used more efficiently <br /> as it all travels in the same bus.|

### Harvard Architecture

Advantages | Disadvantages
------------ | -------------
Can carry out parallel processing as the <br />separation of the data and instruction buses <br /> mean that processes can be carried out <br /> at the same time.| More complex and therefore <br /> more expensive architecture which <br /> takes longer to manufacture.
⠀| Memory can be wasted as free <br /> instruction memory cannot be <br /> used by the programs data.

### Contemporary Architectures

In modern day processors, the Von Neumann architecture is more widely used. It is after all cheaper and makes more efficient use of the RAM as both data and instructions can be stored together.

However, most modern processors will make use of the Harvard architecture in their cache, dividing the cache memory into separate parts, separating data and instructions in order to use parallel processing.

## CISC and RISC CPUs

CPUs control units contain an instruction set. An instruction set is a list of instructions that the control unit can understand and can perform on the data.
However, different CPUs may use one of two types of instruction set:

**CISC** – Complex Instruction Set Computers

**RISC** – Reduced Instruction Set Computers

<br>

### CISC Processors

CISC processors have a certain type of instruction set that will contain a large amount of known instructions.

Advantages of this are:
- Because a complex instruction (e.g multiply) is known to the CPU, it is easy for a compiler to convert a high level language multiply statement into the appropriate assembly language instruction.
- Because it is just one instruction (which may represent several steps), it requires little memory to be stored.

Disadvantages:
- CISC instructions would have to be fully executed before the next could be fetched and so cannot benefit for pipelining.

<br>

### RISC Processors

RISC Processors are the same as CISC Processors except for the fact that they are less complex.

Advantages:
- Because each RISC instruction is simple, each one takes a single clock cycle to be executed.
- This means that RISC processors can benefit from pipelining, whereby as one instruction is being executed, the next can be decoded and the next fetched all at the same time.

Disadvantages:
- A single RISC instruction will not automate all other required steps such as LOAD and STORE.
- As a result, in RISC, more instructions are required to perform a task.

## Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

Continuing on from the notion of parallel processing, GPUs are particularly good at processing multiple jobs in
parallel (at the same time).

A GPU is a ‘Graphics Processing Unit’, which traditionally is responsible for the processing of large blocks of visual
data, very quickly.

Its architecture consists of a great deal of cores, enabling it to handle multiple processes at once.

Often GPUs are separate cards added to a system but they can also be embedded on motherboards.
