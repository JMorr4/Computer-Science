## Von Neumann, Harvard and Contemporary Architectures
In **Von Neumann Architecture**, data and instructions are stored together in the same memory and share the same data bus. However, some computers, mainly specialist and embedded systems, use **Harvard Architecture**.

In Harvard Architecture, data and instructions are stored separately, and use different data buses.

### Von Neumann Architecture

Advantages | Disadvantages                            
------------ | -------------
Only one data bus so less <br /> complex and easier to manage.| Cannot carry out parallel processing as <br /> it carries out one intruction at a time.
One data bus means cheaper <br /> manufacturing costs.|
Memory can be used more efficiently <br /> as it all travels in the same bus.|

### Harvard Architecture

Advantages | Disadvantages
------------ | -------------
Can carry out parallel processing as the <br />separation of the data and instruction buses <br /> mean that processes can be carried out <br /> at the same time.| More complex and therefore <br /> more expensive architecture which <br /> takes longer to manufacture.
-| Memory can be wasted as free <br /> instruction memory cannot be <br /> used by the programs data.
