## Von Neumann, Harvard and Contemporary Architectures
In **Von Neumann Architecture**, data and instructions are stored together in the same memory and share the same data bus. However, some computers, mainly specialist and embedded systems, use **Harvard Architecture**.

In Harvard Architecture, data and instructions are stored separately, and use different data buses.

Advantages | Disadvantages                            
------------ | -------------
Only one data bus so less complex and easier to manage.| Cannot carry out parallel processing as it carries out one intruction at a time.
One data bus means cheaper manufacturing costs.|-
Memory can be used more efficiently as it all travels in the same bus.|-


Advantages | Disadvantages
------------ | -------------
Can carry out parallel processing as the separation of the data and instruction buses mean that processes can be carried out at the same time.| More complex and therefore more expensive architecture which takes longer to manufacture.
-| Memory can be wasted as free instruction memory cannot be used by the programs data.
