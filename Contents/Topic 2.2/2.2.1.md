# Programming Techniques

## Programming Constructs
Types of Constructs:
- A **Sequence** is when tasks are carried out step by step.
- **Selection** is when a decision needs to be made before the next step can be carried out
- **Branching** is when a different instruction set is executed that deviates from the original. In python this can be done using the return or break module.
- **Iteration** is when certain tasks are repeated until a certain condition is met.
  - **Definite iteration**: Count-controlled iteration
  - **Indefinite iteration**: Condition-controlled iteration

## Recursion

Sometimes a problem is too difficult or too complex to solve because it is too big. If the problem can be broken down into smaller versions of itself, we may be able to find a way to solve one of these smaller versions and then be able to build up to a solution to the entire problem. This is the idea behind **recursion**; recursive algorithms break down a problem into smaller pieces which you either already know the answer to, or can solve by applying the same algorithm to each piece, and then combining the results.

In python, recursion can be used by calling a function within the function itself, as shown below:

```python
def function(n):
  if n > 0:
    n -= 1
    function(n)    
 
function(5)
```

## Global and Local Variables

### Local Variables

Local variables in python are variables declared within a function, as seen below:

```python
def function():
  n = "Hello"
  print(n)
  
function()
```

This will output ```Hello```, because the variable is known within the function. However, when the print statement is called outside the function...

```python
def function():
  n = "Hello"

function()
print(n)
```
<br>

### Global Variables

In python, global variables are useful in dealing with functions. Usually a programmer would use ```return n``` to pass the variable out of the function, but one way of getting round this is to declare the variable global, using ```global(n)```, as seen below:

``` python
def function(n):
  n += 1
  return n

function()
```

``` python
def function(n):
  global(n)
  n += 1

function()
```

## Modularity, functions and procedures, parameter passing by value and by reference

**Functions** in python allow a code to be used repeatedly. By passing in values through **parameters**, the function can make use of variables outside the function, without only being able to use local variables. If the function modifies the variable passed in, or wants to pass out a local variable, then it has to use parameters again to **globalise** the variable.

**Modular Programming** is when complex programs are broken down into smaller subroutines to make it easier to understand.

## Uses of an IDE

Common tools and facilities available:
- **Editors** allow programmers to edit their code
- **Error diagnostics** present information following an error and assist in identifying the cause of the error
- **Run-time environment** give the user a running diagnosis of their code
- **Translators** complile the code, converting the high level language into machine code for the computer to understand

## Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP), uses many of the same structures as **procedural programming**. OOP uses classes to create objects that are independant from the rest of the program, such as variables and methods.
- A **method** is a function within a class
- A **procedure** is a function that doesn't return a value

variable inside class = attribute
