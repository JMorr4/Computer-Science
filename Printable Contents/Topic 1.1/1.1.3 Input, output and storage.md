# Input, Output and Storage

## Input and output devices

### Input devices
An **input device** feeds information and data into a computer for processing. Examples of these include:
- Keyboards
- Webcams
- Barcode readers

An **output device** displays the result of the computer's processing. Examples of these include:
- Speakers
- Actuators
- Printers

An **actuator** is a motor commonly used in conjuction with sensors to control a mechanism. Examples of this can be seen in "smart homes".

Some devices can be categorised as both an input and output device. **Touchscreen** takes in information using it's sensors whilst displaying information like a monitor.

## Storage devices

### Storage factors
There are a variety of different ways of storing information. There are 3 main storage types: **Magnetic**, **Optical** and **Flash**, each of which is suited to a particular type of information.

To compare storage types, we consider:
- Speed
- Cost
- Capacity
- Reliability
- Portability
- Durability

### Magnetic
**Magnetic storage** uses two magnetic states to represent binary information: **Polarised** and **unpolarised**. These two states represent the binary digits 1 & 0.

Advantages:
- Relatively cheap form of storage
- Large capacity, usually measured in Terabytes

Disadvantages:
- Slow data transfer speeds
- Easily damaged
- Could be unreliable due to moving parts

### Optical
**Optical storage** are read from and written to using lasers.

The surface of an optical device is made up of flat and sunken portions. The flat portions, called "lands", reflect the laser light that lands on it, whereas the sunken portions, called "pits", scatter it.

In binary, lands represent a **1** and pits represent a **0**.

Advantages:
- Cheap form of storage
- Very portable, so useful for storing music and videos

Disadvantages:
- Small capacity
- Easily damaged by scratches
- Slow transfer speeds

### Flash
**Flash storage** is fast and compact. It works using logic gates to store electrical charge in one of two states: high or low (1 or 0). Information is stored in **pages**, which are combined to form **blocks**.

Flash memory can be erased and reprogrammed electronically, and is **non-volatile**. Although flash memory is similar to RAM, the two differ in that RAM is volatile, so it loses its contents when power is lost, whereas flash memory retains its information.

One problem with flash memory is its limited lifespan. Every time a page is written to, the voltage required to write it increases. Over time, the required voltage will become too high for the page to be written to.

Advantages:
- Extremely light and portable
- Durable due to no moving parts
- High data transfer rates

Disadvantages:
- Expensive
- Limited lifespan

## RAM and ROM

**RAM** and **ROM** are two types of **primary storage**. Primary storage is used by the OS to store data, programs and instructions that the computer is currently using.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Type main memory with very fast access to data
- More expensive per GB than secondary storage devices
- RAM is **volatile**, meaning it loses all its information when power is lost
- This means RAM cannot be used for permanent storage

### Read Only Memory (ROM)
- ROM cannot be modified, meaning that once programmed, the state of its memory cells cannot be changed
- **Non-volatile**, so it stores very important instructions such as the computer's boot program

### Virtual Storage
Instead of storing files in local storage devices in your computer, files can be stored **remotely**. This means that multiple storage devices act like one in order to store your data. These storage devices are collectively known as **virtual storage**.

Advantages of virtual storage:
- Reduced hardware costs
- Users are easily able to scale up or down their storage requirements based on their current needs
- Improved reliability and performance

Disadvantages of virtual storage:
- High costs
- Depends greatly on the user's network speed
- User has to depend on the provider to keep their data secure
