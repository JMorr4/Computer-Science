# Types of Processor

## Von Neumann, Harvard and Contemporary Architectures

### Stored program concept
The **stored program concept** means that:
- A program must be resident in main memory to be executed
- Instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed in the processor one at a time

<br>

### Von Neumann Architecture
In **Von Neumann Architecture**, data and instructions are stored together in the same memory and share the same data bus.


Advantages | Disadvantages                            
------------ | -------------
Only one data bus so less <br /> complex and easier to manage.| Cannot carry out parallel processing as <br /> it carries out one instruction at a time.
One data bus means cheaper <br /> manufacturing costs.|
Memory can be used more efficiently <br /> as it all travels in the same bus.|

<br>

### Harvard Architecture
Some computers use **Harvard Architecture**, where data and instructions are stored separately, and use different data buses. Harvard Architecture can be faster than Von Neumann because data and instructions can be fetched in parallel instead of competing for the same bus.

This can be useful in **embedded systems**, where special-purpose computers are built into devices that operate in real time.

<br>

<br>

Advantages | Disadvantages
------------ | -------------
Can carry out parallel processing as the <br />separation of the data and instruction buses <br /> mean that processes can be carried out <br /> at the same time.| More complex and therefore <br /> more expensive architecture which <br /> takes longer to manufacture.
⠀| Memory can be wasted as free <br /> instruction memory cannot be <br /> used by the programs data.

### Contemporary Architectures

In modern day processors, the Von Neumann architecture is more widely used. It is after all cheaper and makes more efficient use of the RAM as both data and instructions can be stored together.

However, most modern processors can incorporate aspects of both architectures. They can use **Harvard** in their cache, dividing the cache memory into separate parts, separating data and instructions in order to use parallel processing, and they can use **Neumann** to hold both instructions and data in main memory.

The combination of these two architectures is called **Contempory Architecture**.

## CISC and RISC CPUs

CPUs control units contain an **instruction set**. An instruction set is a list of instructions that the control unit can understand and can perform on the data.
However, different CPUs may use one of two types of instruction set:

**CISC** – Complex Instruction Set Computers

**RISC** – Reduced Instruction Set Computers

<br>

### CISC Processors

**CISC** processors have a large instruction set which is used to accomplish common tasks in as few lines of assembly code as possible. Complex instructions are built into the computer's hardware, and these instructions have the capacity to carry out multi-step operations (operations that take more than one cycle to complete).

A CISC processor automatically combines a LOAD/STORE instruction with the instruction that carries out the actual calculation. This is the most distinguishing feature between the two processors.

Advantages:
- Because a complex instruction (e.g multiply) is known to the CPU, it is easy for a compiler to convert a high level language multiply statement into the appropriate assembly language instruction.
- Because it is just one instruction (which may represent several steps), it requires little memory to be stored.

Disadvantages:
- CISC instructions would have to be fully executed before the next could be fetched and so cannot benefit from **pipelining**.
- Many specialised instructions have to be built into the hardware, even though a fraction of these are used in the average program.

<br>

### RISC Processors

**RISC** Processors are the same as CISC Processors except for the fact that they are less complex. This means there are less instructions, and no multi-step ones either. Because of this, RISC processors can benefit from **pipelining**.

Advantages:
- Because each RISC instruction is simple, each one takes a single clock cycle to be executed, making pipelining possible.
- Less instructions have to be built into the hardware.

Disadvantages:
- A single RISC instruction will not automate all other required steps such as LOAD and STORE.
- As a result, in RISC, more instructions are required to perform a task.

<br>

### Co-processor systems
A **co-processor** is an extra processor used to supplement the functions of the CPU. It may not be a general-purpose processor with the ability to carry out the FDE cycle, as a co-processor usually carries out only a limited range of functions.

<br>

### Multi-core and parallel systems
Multi-core CPUs are able to distribute the workload across multiple cores, achieving higher performance. The average computer usually has 2 or 4 cores. However, the performance of the computer will also be dependant on the software being able to take advantage of parallel processing.

Browsers such as Chrome can run several simultaneous processes.

## Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

A **GPU** is a specialised electronic circuit that is used for computer graphics and image processing. It is a form of **co-processor** to the CPU, and is made up of thousands of smaller, more efficient cores in a massively parallel architecture. This makes it suitable for processing large blocks of visual data simultaneously.

In a PC, a GPU may be found on either the **graphics card**, or embedded in the motherboard.
